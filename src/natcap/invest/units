#### PREFIXES ####

# decimal prefixes
nano- =  1e-9  = n-
micro- = 1e-6  = µ- = u-
milli- = 1e-3  = m-
centi- = 1e-2  = c-
deci- =  1e-1  = d-
deca- =  1e+1  = da- = deka-
hecto- = 1e2   = h-

#### BASE UNITS ####

meter = [length] = m = metre
second = [time] = s = sec
ampere = [current] = A = amp
candela = [luminosity] = cd = candle
gram = [mass] = g
mole = [substance] = mol
kelvin = [temperature]; offset: 0 = K = degK = °K = degree_Kelvin = degreeK  # older names supported for compatibility
radian = [] = rad


#### UNITS ####
# Common and less common, grouped by quantity.
# Conversion factors are exact (except when noted),
# although floating-point conversion may introduce inaccuracies

# Angle
degree = π / 180 * radian = deg = arcdeg = arcdegree = angular_degree
arcminute = degree / 60 = arcmin = arc_minute = angular_minute
arcsecond = arcminute / 60 = arcsec = arc_second = angular_second
milliarcsecond = 1e-3 * arcsecond = mas

# Length
# include some extra units of length because they could show up in user-provided rasters
inch = yard / 36 = in = international_inch = inches = international_inches
hand = 4 * inch
foot = yard / 3 = ft = international_foot = feet = international_feet
yard = 0.9144 * meter = yd = international_yard  # since Jul 1959
mile = 1760 * yard = mi = international_mile
nautical_mile = 1852 * meter = nmi
survey_mile = 5280 * survey_foot = smi = us_statute_mile

# Mass
metric_ton = 1e3 * kilogram = t = tonne

# Time
minute = 60 * second = min
day = 24 * hour = d
month = year / 12

# Temperature
degree_Celsius = kelvin; offset: 273.15 = °C = celsius = degC = degreeC
degree_Fahrenheit = 5 / 9 * kelvin; offset: 233.15 + 200 / 9 = °F = fahrenheit = degF = degreeF

# Area
[area] = [length] ** 2
are = 100 * meter ** 2
hectare = 100 * are = ha

# Volume
[volume] = [length] ** 3
liter = decimeter ** 3 = l = L = litre
cubic_centimeter = centimeter ** 3 = cc

# Force
[force] = [mass] * [acceleration]
newton = kilogram * meter / second ** 2 = N

# Energy
[energy] = [force] * [length]
joule = newton * meter = J
watt_hour = watt * hour = Wh = watthour

# Power
[power] = [energy] / [time]
watt = joule / second = W

# If you need to add a new unit, use definitions copied from the latest
# pint default when possible.

# for unitless measurements
none = []

# non-specific unit of value
currency = [value]

# non-specific unit of area
pixel = [raster_area]

# used in coastal vulnerability, the DEM pixel values measure
# elevation (length) but the specific units don't matter
# and in the rec model for cell size

linear_unit = []  # non-specific unit of length

# add "us_survey_foot" on to the aliases because it's used in some rasters
survey_foot = 1200 / 3937 * meter = sft = us_survey_foot

# Vitamin A in the crop production nutrient table is measured in IUs
# A special unit in pharmacology that measures biologically active substances
# May be converted to weight or volume, but conversion factors are specific
# to the substance. I couldn't find a definition of its dimensionality.
international_unit = [biologic_amount] = iu = IU

# use 'h' not 'hr' as the symbol for hour, as per SI guidelines
hour = 60 * minute = h = hr

# use 'year' rather than 'a' as default symbol
# the symbol 'yr' is english-specific and the international symbol 'a' may
# not be well-known, so we will need to translate this
year = 365.25 * day = _ = yr = a = julian_year
